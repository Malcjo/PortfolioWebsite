        "This was a 6 month class group project. there were including me in my group, 3 artists, and me as the programmer. Our goal was to make a platform brawler, inspired by games like Super Smash Brothers using the Unity Game Engine. Going in I was aware of the difficulties of creating such a project but I knew it would push me and teach me a lot. For this project, I learnt about creating a state machine to handle the player's states and interactions. I really enjoyed the creative process of designing the game with my group and problem solving to create the demo. ",
