    description:
      "This was a 6 month class group project. there were including me in my group, 3 artists, and me as the programmer. Our goal was to make a platform brawler, inspired by games like Super Smash Brothers using the Unity Game Engine. Going in I was aware of the difficulties of creating such a project but I knew it would push me and teach me a lot. For this project, I learnt about creating a state machine to handle the player's states and interactions. I really enjoyed the creative process of designing the game with my group and problem solving to create the demo. ",

    description:
      "This is a work-in-progress project with me and a friend. We wanted to design and make a game for the Unreal Engine. I idea was to have a project to work on while learning the engine. I created a foundation project from completing a course and have slowly been tweaking and changing it to fit our desired game design, It's currently in an unrefined MVP state, with only a testing scene."+
      "This project I have found this to be quite difficult, The course was incredible to follow and create some complex systems working together, but progress has slowed down as I've been trying to organise and understand each aspect, I have also found Unreal's Blueprint system to very easily become a visual mess compared to a scripting language."+
      "This project has been great with giving me a more visual demonstration on how Interfaces can interact with different controllers, and how to plan and create code that is more modular.",

      "This was a 1 week assignment where I was meant to produce something that we were not taught, so I decided to learn how to write basic shader code within the Unity engine, as well as create a game to be able to showcase the materials"+
      "The game is inspired by the game katamari, the mathematical calculations in shader code still go right over my head but it's nice to have learned some basics, I want to continue to practice more and learn the maths behind to eventually create some more complex shaders of my own",

      "This project taught me heaps about planning a project and compromising with group conflicts, knowing when to push for something and when to understand when someone can't complete something so need to compromise or finish off things for them.\n"+
      "This project I found quite challenging, dealing with clashes between team members, and planning, I didn't learn too much with the programming aspects but learn heaps about what it's like dealing with a clashing group.",

Challenges I faced were learning how to break apart a given json format without any context and from there being able to generate pieces in a grid formation and having the orientations face the correct directions."+
